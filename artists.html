    <h1>My picks for top 7 music artists</h1>
  
<h3>The following are the 7 artists I think are the best. </h3>

    
<h2><strong>7:The Doors</strong></h2>
    <img width=300 height=300 src="https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AAUvwngvz0pbkq9667srlsZLH1PLZ0h2g7n62Js9HiHaeg=s900-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj">
    <p>
        The Doors are an American band that were formed in 1965. With Jim Morrison on vovals, Ray Manzarek on keyboards, Robby Krieger on guitar, and John Densmore on drums, this band was formed. However, they were only active for 6 years, because Jim Morrison drowned in his bathtub after a heart failure. The Doors are one of the bands I grew up with, alongside The Beatles, and A-ha.
    Their biggest hits are 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbj1RFaoyLk" target="_blank">Light my fire</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHvhFvhLc_A" target="_blank">Riders on the storm</a>, 
    and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHXjcdNIN-Q" target="_blank">LA Woman</a>.
    </p>
    
    
<h2><strong>6:Billy Joel</strong></h2>

    <p>
    Billy Joel is an American music artist, and is known as the Piano Man, after one of his major hit songs. 
        His songs include
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5yDZ-6bWn4" target="_blank">Piano Man</a>, 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCuMWrfXG4E" target="_blank">Uptown Girl</a>, and
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVX80UpMPDI" target="_blank">My Life</a>.
        I think that he is a bit agressive and angry when he was young because his tone and some of the lyrics were a bit agressive. For example, one song says "I don't care what you say anymore this is my life
. Go ahead with your own life leave me alone".

    <h2><strong>5:Daivd Bowie</strong></h2>
    <img width=400 height=300 src="https://e3.365dm.com/21/01/2048x1152/skynews-david-bowie-aladdin-sane_5228197.jpg">
    <p>
  David Bowie was born as David Jones, but changed his name because there was someone called Davy Jones in The Monkees. He is known as the chameleon of rock, because he keeps changing his appearance. First, he's a character called Ziggy Stardust, then he dresses up like a Barbie, then he's in Duke-like clothes. His most famous songs are
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZKcl4-tcuo" target="_blank">Life on Mars</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXgkuM2NhYI" target="_blank">Heroes</a>, 
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYYRH4apXDo" target="_blank">Space Oddity</a>, 
        and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy-rvsHsi1o" target="_blank">Rebel Rebel</a>.
        He also sang a song with Queen called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoDh_gHDvkk" target="_blank">Under Pressure</a>.
    </p>
    
<p>Bowie has a deep and a little husky voice when he shouts, but I still like his songs. I can tell that he is into space, since he has songs and albums names that link to space or aliens.</p>
    
    
    
    
<h2><strong>4:Elton John</strong></h2>
    <p>
        <img width=400 height=500 src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/21/19411824-0-image-m-17_1570478581368.jpg">
             </p>
        <p>
    Elton John was born as Reginald Kenneth Dwight. He is fanous for his song such as 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlPlfCy1urI" target="_blank">Your Song</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ3Bb4UsXhU" target="_blank">Goodbye Yellow Brick Road</a>, 
    and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVBCG6ThDk" target="_blank">Rocket Man</a>, which was also the title of the movie about Eltons John's life. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Elton is also known for his cool costumes. Form wearing a baseball uniform, to an over-the-top colorful feathery design. I really like Elton John's piano sound, and have tried to play some of his songs, but they're very hard. What amazed me most about Elton John was that he actually didn't write all his songs. He only wrote the music, while his friend, Bernie Taupin, wrote all the great lyrics. The piano is great, but I would have liked it if Elton had written all his masterpiece songs.

<h2><strong>3:The Beatles</strong></h2>
    <img width=700 height=300 src="https://cdn.aarp.net/content/dam/aarp/entertainment/music/2014-01/740-beatles-ed-sullivan-show-perform.imgcache.rev0bebe49464331487ae3ce4fff2ef707b.jpg">
    <p> The Beatles are known to be the best rock band, and maybe the best band of all time. But I put them third. 
    The band members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and George Harrison all had successful solo careers after performing together for 8 years. They were together for a short amount of time, but they were a massive hit. Their biggest hits are 
        <a href="">Love me do</a>, 
        <a href="">Let it be</a>, 
        <a href="">Help</a>, 
        and <a href="">Day Tripper</a>
        Ringo Starr is famous within adults as the Beatles drummer, while he is known by the kids as the narrator for Thomas the Tank Engine.
    </p>
  
   
   
    
    
  
<h2><strong>2:The Bee Gees</strong></h2>
    <p>
    <img width=700 height=400 src="http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/Bee-Gees_l_4711.jpg">
    </p>
    <p>The Bee Gees were born in England, but lived in Australia. They are special because the band consist of 3 brothers. Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb. Maurice and Robin are twins, and Barry is the eldest. Their most famous song is 
       <a  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_izvAbhExY" target="_blank">Stayin Alive</a>, and        
        <a  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ihs-vT9T3Q" target="_blank">Night Fever</a>, 
        which was used in the movie Saturday Night Fever. The Bee Gees actually wrote 6 song and sung them in that movie, and also wrote one songh for someone else. 
        I think their biggest trademark is that their vocal harmonies are high pitched for males. All three of the brothers can sing at a high tone. I think that they go higher than an average female singer. 
   </p>
    
    
    
<h2><strong>1:Queen</strong></h2>
    <img width=700 height=400 src="https://img.culturacolectiva.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,w=1600,q=80,fit=contain/content/2017/05/encouraging-queen-songs-band1.jpg">
    <p>
    Queen are a British band, lead by one of the greatest frontman Freddie Mercury, will come on top of my list. My favourite Queen songs include 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9rUzIMcZQ" target="_blank">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM" target="_blank">Don't Stop Me Now</a>, 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM" target="_blank">Don't Stop Me Now</a>, and
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azdwsXLmrHE" target="_blank">Radio Gaga</a>.
    I reckon that Queen are one of the smartest bands. Freddie Mercury earned a degree in graphic and art design. The drummer, Roger Taylor, was on his way to be a dentist before joining Queen. The bassist, John Deacon, was a trained engineer and built the Deacy Amp. The guitarist, Brian May, has a PhD in astrophysics, and has an IQ of 170-180.
    </p>
    <p>
    I think that Queen's best live show is when they stole the show at the Live Aid 1985.
