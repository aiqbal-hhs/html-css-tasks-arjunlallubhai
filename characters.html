    <h1>My picks for top 7 Cartoon Characters</h1>
<p>The following are the 7 cartoon characters I like the most. By personality, and by looks. Some of them will come in pairs, because without eachother, they won't be great as they are. </p>





    
    
    <h2>7: Snoopy and Woodstock</h2>

    <p>
    Snoopy is the Beagle that appears in the comic strips written by Charles.M.Schulz. Snoopy was inspired by Spike, one of Schulz's chiclhood dogs. The other main characters are Snoopy's owner Charlie Brown, and Woodstock the bird, who is Snoopy's best friend and side kick. He was named after the Woodstock festival of 1969. In the comics, most of them have 8 boxes, and they tell the whole story of each scene.

  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/00/Popeye_the_Sailor.png/220px-Popeye_the_Sailor.png">
<p>
    Popeye is a sailor who possesses superhuman strength after ingesting an always-handy can of spinach, and always seen with a pipe in his mouth. He normally swallows the spinach, or sucks it with his pipe. Popeye's enemy is Bluto, the big bearded muscley bully who mainly tries to win Olive Oyl from Popeye.

    <h2>3: Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd</h2>

    <img src="https://www.pngjoy.com/pngl/219/4275800_elmer-fudd-bugs-bunny-transparent-png.png">

<p>
  Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd are characters from the Loony Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons. Elmer tries to shoot Bugs Bunny, which he does in the ends. Most of the time, Bugs outsmarts Elmer Fudd, and the only preson who has outsmarted Bugs is Cecil the turtle. I like Bugs because he seems pretty chill and is pretty cunning and smart. 
</p>

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
<h2>2: Pink Panther</h2>
    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/pinkpanther/images/5/52/PInky.png/revision/latest/top-crop/width/360/height/450?cb=20180710051852">
    <p>
    The pink panther, is a pink panther, and represents a large, valuable pink diamond in the movie The Pink Panther. I like him because of his looks as well as his funny and silly personality.
    </p>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <h2>1:Road Runner and Coyote</h2>
    <img width=400 height=400 src="https://dugout.uni-watch.com/app/uploads/2019/06/0f5036f3966e6bb4fc610c4a7342869b.png">
<p>
Road runner and Coyote are cartoons characters from the Loony Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons. Everytime, Coyote tries to catch the Road runner and eat him up, but fails everytime exept for once. He has tired with ways such as strapping himself to a rocket, trying to use hypnosis, and many other wacky ideas. Neither of them talk, but the Road Runner ocasionally goes "beep beep". I like watching the mad ways Coyote invents to try to catch the Road Runner.
