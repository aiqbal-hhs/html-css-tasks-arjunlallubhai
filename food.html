<h1>My picks for top 7 Foods</h1>
<p>
    All these are foods I have eaten, and are not gourmet foods. I have included foods that I think are pretty nice, and would reccomend to eat.
    </p>
  <h2>7:Baked cheesecake</h2>

<p>
There are a few differences between baked cheesecake and non-baked cheesecake. First of all, baked cheesecake is baked in the oven, while the other type isn’t. The baked cheesecake has eggs in it, while the non-baked cheesecake doesn’t. Both types need to be chilled in the fridge to set. Baked cheesecake is dense and velvety, while no-bake cheesecake is light and airy. I don't think that I have had non bake cheesecake before (maybe I have, but I just didn’t realise), so I will say that baked cheesecake is more nice. I prefer dense cakes over light cakes anyway.

    <h2>6:Ramen</h2>
<img width=400 height=400 src="https://images.japancentre.com/recipes/pics/233/main/photo_Japanese-Ramen-Noodles.jpg">
    <p>Ramen is a Japanese noodle soup. It consists of wheat noodles served in a meat or fish-based broth, often flavored with soy sauce or miso, and uses toppings such as sliced pork, nori, menma, corn, naruto, and eggs. For those who are wondering, I am not talking about that anime character Naruto.
    
   Narut is a type of fish cake that is a classic topping for ramen, which is made by wrapping white fish paste colored with red food dye with undyed fish paste into a log shape.

    <p>Oinarisan, or commonly known as Inari suschi is a little like sushi. It is made of sushi rice, which is venegar rice, and the rice is stuffed inside a seasoned deep-fried tofu pockets called Inari Age. I nari sushi is very sweet and kind of sour, and is very nice.  </p>

    
    
    <h2>4: Spicy BBQ pork fried rice</h2>

    <p>Spicy BBQ pork fried rice is fried rice with spicy BBQ pork. It has a spicy flavour and the rice also has a strong nice flavour. The only Spicy BBQ pork fried rice I eat is from a takeaway shop in Mangere, near my dad's workplace, and he gets it on the way home from work.

    <h2>3:Pasta</h2>

    <p>
    Pasta is an Italian dish made from a mixture of flour, water, and sometimes eggs that is formed into different shapes (such as thin strips, tubes, or shells) and usually boiled first before cooking. I like spicy pasta, which is just plain pasta flavoured with garlic, olive oil, rosemary and chilli flakes. 
    </p>
    
    
    
    <h2>2: Dumplings</h2>

    <p>Dumplings are dough wrapped around a filling, or of dough with no filling. The dough can be based on bread, flour or potatoes, and may be filled with meat, fish, cheese, vegetables, fruits or sweets. I like eating pork dumplings with chives, and I like them pan fired. I like dipping them in sauce, which is amde of soy sauce and vinegar, and I put in lots of chilli flakes.

    <h2>1: Pizza</h2>
    <img width=400 height=400 src="http://gorestaurants.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/hot-pizza.jpg">
    <p>
    Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with various ingredients, which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. The first pizza had tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil, to represent the flag of Italy. It was named Margarita after the reigning queen. My favourite pizza is the Godfather pizza and the simple Hawaiian pizza.
