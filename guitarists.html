<h2>Here are the guitarists that I think are the best/ I have not included some great guitarists such as

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(musician)" target="_blank">Slash</a>. That is because I have not really heard their guiotar solos properly to actually know and judge them.

<h1>7:Jose Feliciano</h1>
<img width=400 height=300 src="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f1b10e8250000780fc2a4da.jpeg?ops=scalefit_630_noupscale">
<p>Jose Feliciano is a Puetro Rican musician, who was born blind. He is the only acoustic guitarist on this list. He made covers of many songs including
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RtTWDv-yWM" target="_blank">Light my fire</a>, originally by the Doors, 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvA5k8oUEL0" target="_blank">Gotta get a message to you</a>, oroginally by the Bee Gees, 
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKIrqC2QUvg" target="_blank">California Dreaming</a>, originally written by the Mamas and the Papas. 
The reason that I chose him is because even though he is blind, he can play the guitar beautifully and makes good cover versions of songs. Most of his cover songs don't sound like the original, and he occasionally adds aditional lyrics, sometimes in Spanish.

<h1>6:Chuck Berry</h1>

    <p>
    Chuck Berry is known as the father of rock'n'roll, and was most active in 1953. Even John Lennon said that is he was to give rock'n'roll another name, he would call it Chuck Berry. Chuck Berry used a one-legged hop during his concerts as well as his trademark duck walk. He also does the splits, and rolls his neck, and does many other warm-up activities. His most famous songs are 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6PryLdLZXY" target="_blank">Jhonny B.Goode</a>, 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sij1R6cjh4A" target="_blank">Roll over Beethoven</a>, 
        and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjrQWU2EcsA" target="_blank">Maybelene</a>. 
    </p>

    <h1>5:Brian May</h1>
<img width=300 height=500 src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/05/16/c2/0516c284153ab62a2e163eb3a9dbffdc.jpg">
<p>
  Brian May is the guitarist of the British rock band Queen. He made his giutar he used during his time with Queen with his dad when he was in his teens. Instead of a pick, he uses a coin. His classic guitar solos include
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ9rUzIMcZQ" target="_blank">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>, 
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8Rfb1Jtmic" target="_blank">Stone cold crazy</a>, 
  and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JofwEB9g1zg" target="_blank">Keep yourself alive</a>. Even though he is a rock guitarist, he has an IQ of 170-180, and has a Bachelor's degree in Physics and has a PhD in Astrophysics.

<h1>4:George Harrison</h1>
<img width=400 height=450 src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/36/b9/b8/36b9b8fa62878fe6aa163760cefa65e9.jpg">
<p>
    George Harrison was the left-handed guitarist for the successful Beatles and had a good solo career after that.  George Harrison didn't have blindingly fast fingers or was very dazzling, but made many great melodies. He played lead guitar and bass guitar for the Beatles.
His famous giutar melodies include
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQetemT1sWc" target="_blank">Here comes the sun</a>, 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJDJs9dumZI" target="_blank">While my guitar gently weeps</a>, 
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UelDrZ1aFeY" target="_blank">Something</a>.</p>

    
<h1>3:Eric Clapton</h1>
<img src="https://glide-assets-media.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/21155121/clapton2.jpg">
<p>Eric Clapton has been in many bands, such as the Yardbirds and Cream, before he went for a solo career in 1970. His best songs include 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fX5USg8_1gA" target="_blank">Layla, </a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3y8jf01UY8" target="="_blank>Sunshine of your love (with Cream)</a>
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJDJs9dumZI" target="_blank">While my guitar gently weeps.</a>
I mentioned for  George Harrison, that Harrison made the melody, but it was actually Clapton to played it at the studio.</p>


<h1>2:Jimmy Page</h1>
<img width=400 height=300 src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2013/01/JP2.jpg?w=980&q=75">
<p>
    Jimmy Page is the guitarist of the British rock band Led Zeppelin. He was in seven bands before he made Led Zepplein. His classic solos include
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbhCPt6PZIU" target="_blank">Stairway to heaven</a>, 
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiLKT5rPHBA" target="_blank">Whole lotta love</a>, 
  and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBuub4Xe1mw" target="_blank">Black dog</a>
  He sometimes played his guitar with a violin bow. 
  
  Just a fun fact, but he shares the same birthday as me, January 9<sup>th</sup>.

<h1>1:Jimi Hendrix</h1>
<img src="https://hardrockhideout.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/hendrix.jpg">
<p>
Jimi Hendrix was left handed, but his father tried to force him to play guitar right handed, because he thought playing left handed was a sign of the devil. Hendrix could do cool tricks when playing the guitar. He could play it behind his back, between his legs, and even play with his teeth. He burnt 2 giutars onstage in his 4 year career.  His famous songs include 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmGFFJtkDXA" target="_blank"> All along the watchtower </a>, 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjwWjx7Cw8I" target="_blank">Purple Haze</a>, 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eJz0kdOrLw" target="_blank" >Hey Joe</a>.
He probably would have made many great guitar songs, but he died at the age of 27.
