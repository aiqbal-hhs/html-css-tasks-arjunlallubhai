    <h2>In this site, I have listed what I think is the top 7 of each category in my opinion. <br>
    For some of the things in the Top 7, I haven't seen or read it, but I have heard the main plot, and I am judging on that as well. For some, you may find that there are things or people that should be on my list. So this is more like reccommendations as well as my picks. </h2>
