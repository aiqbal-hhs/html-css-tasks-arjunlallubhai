    <h1>My picks for top 7 Movies</h1>
 <p>The following are the 7 movies I think are the best. For some of them, I have only seen the first part, or haven't seen anything but have only heard of it. </p>
   <h2>7: A series of Unfortunate events</h2>

Starring Jim Carey as Count Olaf
<p>
After the three young Baudelaire siblings, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are left orphaned by a fire in their mansion, they are carted off to live with their distant relative, Count Olaf. Unfortunately, Olaf is a cruel, scheming man only after the inheritance that Violet is set to receive. The children escape and find shelter with their quirky Uncle Monty, and next with Aunt Josephine, but Olaf deals with them both.

      <h2>6: James Bond series</h2>
    <img width=400 height=600 src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSNSGqQFGwSef-3T7jzSCx4BNeeJyBoMXO-FHHytMs1B_QsfxW0"><br>
    Starring Daniel Craig, Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and more, all playing James Bond in different movies.
    <p>
    The James Bond movies were actually based on the books written by Ian Flamming. James Bond is a secret agent known as Agent 007. He is exceptionally skilled in martial arts, and has a great ability in melee combat. He goes on secret missions to uncover gangs or to fight bad people. I have not seen any of it yet, but I want to, since I am interested in spy and secret agent stories. 
    </p>
    
      <h2>5: Starwars series</h2>
    <img width=400 height=600 src="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT-nJgNLQvmxPsh17_9BWVg969c2QZ70VVOH4wNgTJzeF7IAB3a"><br> 
    Starring Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker and Henry Ford as Han Solo.
    <p>The story of the original trilogy focuses on Luke Skywalker's quest to become a Jedi, his struggle with the evil Imperial agent Darth Vader, and the struggle of the Rebel Alliance to free the galaxy from the clutches of the Galactic Empire. I have only seen the first movie, Star Wars: A New Hope, but I have basically heard what happens all along, and I think it is a good movie. 
</p>
    
      <h2>4:Night at the museum</h2>
    <img width=400 height=600 src="https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/p162718_p_v10_aa.jpg"><br>
    Starring Ben Stillers as Larry.
    <p>Larry, a night security guard at the Museum of Natural History, gets some help from the exhibits in the museum, who come alive at night to foil a robbery attempt of a magic tablet of Tutankhamun. Without that tablet, the museum exhibits won't be able to come to life at night and roam around the museum. I have seen it once, and I really liked the story as well as the historical characters. I would like to watch parts 2 and 3. </p>
    
    
      <h2>3:The Pink Panther</h2>
    <img width=400 height=600 src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRAOpj4DzxdJ_MmO5TlB86dvZNLsCT1Pr2SFNMBrohBeJE62r0x"><br>
    Starring Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau.
    <p>The Pink Panther primarily focuses on a series of comedy-mystery films featuring an inept French police detective, Inspector Jacques Clouseau. In this movie, Inspector Jacques needs to retrive a precious pink gem that is known as the Pink Panthe, which has been stolen. I haven’t seen the movie yet, but I have watched the trailer, and I really want to watch it. </p>
    
      <h2>2:Harry Potter series</h2>
    <img width=400 height=600 src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT_9nrOnN8sYfZZHJ06EIBSoEO5qjx7uHHEs6VtKNplGVuGhZuC"><br>
    Starring Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Ruper Gint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger.
    <p>
    Harry Potter, although an ordinary boy in the normal world, has potentially great power as a wizard. In appearance, Harry is a slight, dark-haired boy with a scar on his forehead left from a magical battle that occurred when he was an infant. He goes through many problems and adventures with his two loyal friends, Ron and Hermione, and battles Voldemort and his forces. 
    </p>
    
      <h2>1:School of Rock</h2>
    <img width=400 height=600 src="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRMRyrfvOfl7RStLTmLNBIf86oc677YSkxdw1XeNHV928aAdL_3"><br>
Starring Jack Black as Dewey Finn
    <p>
Dewey Finn, a failed, wannabe rock star, who gets kicked out of his own band, decides to earn a few extra bucks by pretending to be a substitute teacher at a prep school. There he turns a class of straight-A students into a rock band, which he takes to compete in the battle of bands.
